- Separate drving function for both wheels to be able to drive both wheels at different speeds and directions.
- PID
- Differential steering
- Differential braking
- Add weight to back to decrease drifting on turns
- Tuning constants -
    -- Servo duty cycle constants
    -- Left / right constants when turning left / right
    -- Deadzone on not turning
